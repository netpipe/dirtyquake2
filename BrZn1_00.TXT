Description : A non-restrictive modification for Quake2
	
	What to say...

	Hmmm...

	Stuff it, just play the damn thing!


================================================================
                        LIST OF FEATURES
================================================================
        For proper descriptions visit the web page
        at "www.planetquake.com/brazen" or just read
        the included manual (Manual.htm).

        Main:
        - Weight that reduces movement and carrying capacity.
        - Wounds, including leg and head damage.
        - Two weapon style.
        (Like 'Guns Akimbo', but you can also use two different weapons)
        - Advanced Hit location based damage, including Arms, legs, head etc.
        - Actions including corpse searching, climbing and kicking.

        Item and weapon related:
        - Weapon damage based on range and weapon type.
        - Ability to shoot through walls and people.
        - Weapons that require reloading.
        - Weapon accuracy affected by stance, movement and water.
        - Water affects a weapons ability to fire and/or effectiveness.
        - Realistic item manipulation (Option).

        Icing on the already great cake:
        - Map list.
        - Multiple defineable teams.
        - CTF Support (Up to FOUR teams).
        - Smart Audio.
        - Match Game support.


        HEAPS OF OTHER THINGS!

================================================================

* Play Information *

Single Player           : Yes
Deathmatch (2-16+)      : Yes               
	                  Desgined more for team games.
CTF (2-16+)             : Yes (Up to 4 teams)  
	                  Basically the same as Zoid's Threewave CTF (W/O Hook).
New Sounds              : Yes, a few.
				A couple are from The TronicSound-TC 
				for Quake2 by Tronicmind. Others were 
				created or modified from other sources.

New Graphics            : Yes, lots (And I am not good at making models).
New Music               : No.

* Construction *

Base                    : Quake2 DLL 3.20 Source
Editor(s) used          : LCC, PSP, Edit, Sound Forge 3.0, ModLer v0.83(?)
Known Bugs        	: Aside from some bugs I have not been able to reproduce (A Mick bug), 				there arn't really any I know about. Each time I edit something, I am 				bound to add a possible bug.

			The base for this version has been tested thoroughly on a LAN and on 
			the internet, and found to be very stable, over all.  There is always 
			a chance I missed things though, usually something stupid.


Build Time              : It Took Me Ages So...
Source Included		: No.

* Install Instructions and usage *

Server:
        UNZIP, SET UP CONFIGS,
        RUN "quake2 +set game brazen +set dedicated 1 +set deathmatch 1"
        For teams games add "+set teams <number of teams>"
        For CTF games add "+set ctf 1"
        For CTF games add "+set match 1"

Client:
        UNZIP IT.
        RUN "quake2 +set game brazen"
        Set up your keys MANUALLY! (PREFERABLY)
        If you use the set up in Quake2 you are likely to stuff the config
        up.  Remember, +attack2 = second attack button.

FINAL NOTES:
	When I started, I had a plan...
	Now that I am done with it, I am no where near the plan.
	I failed to achieve many things I wanted, simply because 
	they were not possible with Quake2 mods.
	With other things, I went well beyond what I thought I would...

        Please do not rip me off, blantantly or otherwise.
        Not only would I be upset, but I'm sure, deep down, you would be too...

        I can be so full of shit sometimes :)
