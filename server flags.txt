SERVER FLAG LIST
================

// bflags
BF_CHOOSE_STUFF         1       = choose equipment
BF_JOHN_WOO             2       = everyone starts with 6 pistols

BF_CTF_TOUCH            256     = only need to touch the flag to capture it
BF_FLAGS_STAY           512     = dropped flag can't be picked up by its team
BF_FLAGS_MBCB           1024    = dropped flag must be carried back by its team
BF_CTF_R_RESPAWN        2048    = respawn out of base

// realflags
RF_NO_EQUIPMENT         1       = no items spawn in the level

// sv_jumpgrav ###      = jump gravity (default 800)
                        Acts exactly the same as sv_gravity, but only affects
                        players and only when they jump. Has the side affect
                        of lowering fall damage, even if a player falls off
                        a building.

// match 0/1            = turn rounds off/on

// ctf 0/1              = turn Capture The Flag off/on

// teams 0-8            = number of teams you want (max = 7 actually)

// forcejoin 0/1        = auto-matically asign players to teams

// goal_limit #         = team max score (rounds one, captures etc)

// round_timelimit #    = min 3, no max. In minutes


// sv_itemchoices - add the item's classname to ALLOW it
        "none" = no items allowed
        item_armor_jacket
        item_laser_sight
        item_slippers
        item_silencer
        item_bandolier
        item_flash_light

// sv_weaponchoices : add the weapons's classname to ALLOW it
        "none" = fists only
        weapon_mp5
        weapon_shotgun
        weapon_cannon
        weapon_sniper
        weapon_rifle
        weapon_knife
        weapon_pistol
        ammo_grenades

// max_junk ##          = max number of bullet holes, gibs, etc that can exist at the same time.
                        Suggest setting this to 32 (or less) for net servers.
                        This limits everything, even if they are set higher

// max_gibs ##          = max number of gibs that can exist at one time.

// max_debris ##        = max number of debris (glass etc) that can exist at one time.

// max_bhole ##         = N/A

// max_blood ##         = N/A

// max_knives ##        = max number of knives that can exist at one time.
                        Unlike other limits, this is not restricted by max_junk.
