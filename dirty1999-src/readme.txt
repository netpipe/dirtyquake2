Dirty - ??/??/1999 SRC
-----------------------------------

This souce is supplied *AS IS*.
It isn't pretty.
It isn't bug free.
It does contain swearing and other misc comments.

This is the source code from the last version of Dirty I was on before I ended up on Action Half-Life.

All changes/additions to *original* files are marked "// GRIM <date>"

If you are a mod author looking to use 'X' feature in you're own mod, feel free to do so,
provided you give credit where credit is due. I'd appreciate it if you also dropped me a
line. Would like to know who's doing what with what etc :)
